# Contributing to This Project

This project is a container for multiple different projects. Each seperate page is its own project
and you can work on any of them as you please.

We also have a place for all of our reusable components which will come in handy in the future. It's located
right below the .next folder and above our node_modules folder as one of the main directories.

## Our Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Material UI
- Yarn
- ESLinter
- Jest

## Work Flow

To start, create a branch with the name of the feature you are working on.
EX:

```bash
git checkout -b todoAddButton
```

Do all of your work in this branch.
Then you want to push this branch `todoAddButton` and create a pull request to the `main` on GitHub.
